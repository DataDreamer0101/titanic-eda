# Titanic EDA

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset using Python**

## Overview
This project analyzes the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle: *“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster”*.  
The goal is to explore the dataset, clean it, generate insights, and visualize patterns related to passenger survival.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Contents: Passenger information such as Age, Sex, Class, Embarked, etc.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Exploration**
   - View top rows, check data types, summary statistics
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical columns to appropriate types
3. **Summary Statistics & Group-based Insights**
   - Survival by Gender
   - Survival by Class
   - Survival by Age Group & Gender
   - Survival by Embarkation Port & Class
4. **Visualization**
   - Bar plots, stacked bars, heatmaps, KDE/violin plots
   - Highlight patterns and correlations
5. **Tools & Libraries**
   - Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Findings
- Females had higher survival rates than males
- 1st class passengers survived more than lower classes
- Certain embarkation ports showed higher survival trends
- Age distribution affected survival probabilities

## How to View
1. Open the `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` notebook on GitHub to see all analyses and visuals.
2. Optionally, download the notebook and run locally using Python.

## Optional Extensions
- Build a predictive model (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict survival (not included in this EDA).
